SYN Scan (Standard Scan)

sudo nmap -sS 192.168.50.5
```
Null-Sacn (Very Stealhy)
```
sudo nmap -sN 192.168.50.5
```
IP-Spoofing (extra Layer STH
```
IP spoofing alters the source IP in scanned packets to obfuscate your scanning host. While not spoofing itself, it adds an extra layer of stealth:
This makes your scans appear to originate from the bogus source IP rather than your true scanning system.

nmap --spoof-source 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.25
```
Fragmented Packets
```bash
Fragmenting the scanned packets breaks them into multiple pieces to avoid triggering IDS signatures tuned to whole packets.

nmap --mtu 24 192.168.1.25
```
